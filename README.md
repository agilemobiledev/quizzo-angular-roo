# AngularJS and Spring Roo - Sample Project #
This project is an attempt to fully work out an AngularJS application
using a Spring-based backend, specifically with Spring Roo.

This will be an end-to-end test of a client/server application that runs
a quizzo engine - a sort of online quiz creation and hosting service. I
will use this project as grist for blog entries on my website, <a
href="http://rimple.com">www.rimple.com</a> and for material for demonstration.
